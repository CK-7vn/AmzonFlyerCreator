## Flyer Creator ##
Python Tkinter based GUI that takes an Amazon link, and then parses the html and pulls the Item name, price, and image, and appends the items to a list. User can then save as flyer, which creates a flyer 
item image, item name, and price, or the user can save as list which just saves a docx file of the Item name, price, and amazon link for later lookup. 

Nothing too serious, just a fun little program to help do a project for the facility.
